on every frame need to produce and research.
1) Get base system for troop production (marines, vultures, siege machines, goliaths).
2) Get base system for research/upgrades (getting siege mode is high priority).
3) Incorporate troop requests from unit manager (1/2 for requests, 1/2 for default, for now).
4) Test default troop combos and research order to see what wins more often.*/
